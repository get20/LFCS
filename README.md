# LFCS
Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS) 

These are my notes that I have wrote during my preparation for LFCS exam.

The notes structure is based on Certification Preparation Guide - September 2023.

These notes contain instructions/commands for Ubuntu Linux Distribution.

These notes cannot be considered as unique source of information to prepare LFCS exam, but can be used as guideline to understand which topics you must be able to manage to pass the exam.
